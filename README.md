# Embracing experiences
## I wanted a feature-rich content management system where my wife and I could document trips and outdoor activities. This project makes it easy for me to log in with Google, add text, images, videos, and even a final quiz question at the end of a blog post and the location on the map. I will continue to develop this project over time.
